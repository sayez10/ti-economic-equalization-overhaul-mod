             * Exponential decay function that gives low-GDPPC countries a considerable boost to growth. Heavily modified from the original mod author's vision.
             *
             * This was done because growth simply didn't make sense in the original mod. Poor countries grew WAY too fast, and rich countries were practically stagnant.
             * Take China and the US (the main countries I balanced this mod around) for example. In the real world, China's GDP 2022-2023 growth percentage was about 66% quicker than in the US.
             * In the original run of this mod, the US had about 15% the growth rate of China.
             * With this new function, China should have a mostly-accurate natural growth rate compared to the US.
             * More importantly, China still has a lot of potential but isn't so powerful that choosing any other major power is a bad idea.
             * Note that during testing, China invested 24% of its IP into Economy, and the US invested 21%. This is what the factionless AI does, so that is what I kept it at.
             * Democracy and education have a strong effect on GDP growth, so the US' raw multiplier (at game start) is about half of China's, but after other factors it's ~60%.
             *
             * Anyways, the big numbers, at default values:
             * 100%   growth rate at   0k GDPPC
             *  75%   growth rate at  21k GDPPC
             *  62.5% growth rate at  35k GDPPC
             *  50%   growth rate at  51k GDPPC
             *  37.5% growth rate at  73k GDPPC
             *  25%   growth rate at 102k GDPPC
             *
             * The main takeaway from this is that poor nations get a strong bonus, which drops off relatively quickly. Rich ones get diminishing - but (hopefully) manageable - returns.
